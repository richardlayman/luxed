Introduction
---------------
LuxEd is a GUI editor for Lux scene and config files. It's intended for 3d artist that want to have full access to Lux's features without having to use Blender. The idea is to export your mesh data to ply or stl files and then use LuxEd to assemble the scene, shade and light it. LuxEd can then export the files for batch rendering. This breaks the connection with Blender allowing for a more diverse pipeline.

Installation
---------------
LuxEd is a single python file that you can run straight from the folder; it doesn't look for any other files or assets. LuxEd was developed and tested on Linux but should work fine on any other operating system.

Status
---------------
CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM IS BROKEN WHILE I ADD A SCENEGRAPH TO HANDLE THE PROPERTIES. This shouldn't take long to fix and get the app back up and running.
